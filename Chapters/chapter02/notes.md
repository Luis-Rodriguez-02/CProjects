# Chapter 2

- C goes through various stages before being run
- C -> Preprocessor -> Compiler -> Linker
- Preprocessor - Reads and processes directives ie (#include <stdio.h>
- We can read input with scanf, print input with printf (can also evaulate expressions)
- %d decimal, %f float, \n newline character
- We can define constants ( macro definition) #define CONSTANT VALUE, preprocessor replaces each macro by the value it represents

# C Programming Projects – A Modern Approach

This repository contains all the hands-on exercises and projects I complete while studying *C Programming: A Modern Approach* by K.N. King.

## 📚 Purpose

To master the fundamentals of C programming by building real examples and custom tools, reinforcing learning with hands-on coding.

## 🛠️ Structure

- `chapterXX/`: Contains exercises from individual chapters
- `projects/`: Larger custom C projects or book-end challenges
- `Makefile`: (Optional) For compiling multiple programs easily

## ✅ Progress

| Chapter | Status  | Notes                     |
|---------|---------|---------------------------|
| 01      |  | Hello World, printf       |
| 02      |  | Types, variables, input   |
| 03      |  | Operators, expressions    |
| ...     |         |                           |

## 🔧 How to Compile

To compile a single `.c` file:
```bash
gcc chapter01/ex1_hello_world.c -o hello
./hello
